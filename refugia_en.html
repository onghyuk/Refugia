            Éliane Radigue recorded the movements of fetus when she was pregnant with her son and
when her daughter was pregnant with her first grandchild. She recorded the pulse and
heartbeat as a material and composed Biogenesis, using only a stethoscope, a microphone,
and an ARP synthesizer. The work considered the gradual change of high-frequency notes
and the way the musical narrative develops. The title of the work Biogenesis refers to
“Biogenesis,” the theory that living creatures must come from living things. This concept is
contrary to the “Spontaneous Generation” theory that God created living things.
            </ins></p>
            <p><ins class="text">
            Radigue converted to Tibetan Buddhism in the 1970s and practiced with Pawo Rinpoche Guru
for three years. She discovered that there was a lot of potential in the way ARP synthesizers
interpreted notes as if they meditated on them. She created the sound by slightly changing
parameters such as frequency and modulation, up to 40. It was Radigue’s own composition
method, contrary to the twelve-tone technique of the male composers Pierre Schaeffer and
Pierre Henry, who were the masters of concrete music. Radig says, “My composition has
always avoided dramatic changes, and this is still the rule. All notes change very slowly.
They develop so slowly that you do not even notice that they are changing.”

            Éliane Radigue, based in Paris, was impressed by listening to concrete music artist Pierre
Schaeffer&#39;s L&#39;étude aux chemins de fer on the radio. She learned to manipulate magnetic
tapes and mastered tape feedback techniques while working with Pierre Henry, another
leading artist of concrete music, at the Studio d&#39;Essai of RTF Paris, the French national radio
and television station studio. In the 1970s, the artist immigrated to the United States, and she
composed a &quot;deliberately slow&quot; sound that combined the beats of ARP 2500 synthesizers at
New York University, the University of Iowa, and CalArts music studios. After she became a
Tibetan Buddhist in 1975, she began to publish her La Trilogie de la mort in 1988. Her sound
work is characterized by repeated feedback and loops based on precise and accurate details.
She still continues to create acoustic sound works in close collaboration with musicians she

interacts with around the world. In recognition of her over 50 years of her achievements, she
won the Golden Nica Award at Ars Electronica in 2006 and the Giga-Hertz Award for
Electronic Music at ZKM, Germany in 2019. She is regarded as one of the most influential
pioneers of electro-acoustic music.

            <p><ins class="text">Transmitted by word of mouth through generations, folk songs can only continue to pass
down if it sparks “empathy” among the contemporary generation. Folk songs are like the
stories of life, and the sounds of life. With the changing times, however, the traditional folk
song genre of labor song is on the verge of vanishing into history. Could Is This Right
continue to pass on as a folk song? In order to expand the voice into the realm of others, the
song delivers the sound through the voice of others, rather than the self.
</ins></p>
           <p><ins class="text">What would it mean to compose the lyrics as a question? The dictionary defines a “question”
as an “interrogative expression used to find out about something,” but in Is This Right, the
question is not aimed to elicit an answer. The question cannot be answered, since there is no
certainty in the answer, nor any obligation to answer. The question itself is whether it should
be answered at all. The questioning must go on. The question has been continuously asked,

continues to ask, and will continue to be asked. Perhaps, through the question, each of us can
at least get a sense of the direction to which we should or should not be headed.

Ye-eun Min received her bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degree from École Supérieur d’Art
Clermont Métropole in France. The artist held four solo exhibitions including Unpredictable
Invisibility (Alternative Space LOOP, Seoul, 2019), Sens Dessus Dessous (Korean Cultural
Center, Paris, 2015), also participated in several group exhibitions Time Reality:
disconnection, trace, oblivion (Coreana Museum of Art, Seoul, 2019), De la nature des liens

discomfort, disorder, dispersion, dissonance, interference and so on which arise from
heterogeneous culture. Artworks as entities form relationships and inflict influences on each
other. Through numerous efforts in trying to find a balance, they’ll reach equality. Min mixes
diverse media to homogenize them, and explores social interactions and exchanges, while
looking for the adequate territory for cultural sharing.

northern coast of Bretagne, France. It is “l’ÎLE AUX FEMMES,” which resembles the shape

women in Nantes, Bretagne. It was recorded by ethnic musicologist Patrice Coirault. It was
the song that was in a dialect strong enough not to be recognized in French. The artist began
to study the obscene songs sung by women which are no longer oral, and made new songs
based on the lyrics. The video work shows two young women singing while traveling around
the “The Island of Women.” They sing while feeling nature away from computer screens and
boring labor. People sing. Amusement is also the essence of people.

Seulgi Lee lived in Paris since 1992 and her work focuses on the practice of comprehensive
craft, intersection and correlation with language via her own experience. Including the
experience in Mexico and Morocco, she has built a contemporary formative language,
including the work of visualizing Korean proverbs in geometric patterns by utilizing quilts as
a medium (cooperated with quilted quilt artisans in Tongyeong). Solo exhibitions of her work
have been organized through WE ARE NOT SYMMETRICAL (la Casa da Cerca art centre,
Almada, 2020), SOONER’S 2 DAYS BETTER (La Criée centre d’art contemporain, Rennes,
2019), DAMASESE (Galerie Jousse Entreprise, Gallery Hyundai, 2017-18), and has taken a

            <p><ins class="text">Jaguar’s Vision is a short animation film narrating an encounter between four humans living in
a jungle and a jaguar. In the past, humans continued to live as a part of nature – learning from
nature, revering nature, and understanding nature in its wonderous existence. Nature was a
realm of life in which humans can gather food and sustain life, but at the same time, a realm
of cruel and ruthless competition in which different elements threatened their survival.
Humans have survived in nature through cooperation. The current global spread of COVID-
19 proves that cooperation between both individuals and collectives remains crucial for
human survival even in contemporary times. As humans cemented their position as the
dominating species in nature, they became the fearless of the world. However, the power
dynamics between humans and nature still persists through the conflicts between individuals,
collectives, nations, and races. Through this work, I wanted to question what humans have
lost in relationships with one another at the cost of declaring themselves as the dominators
of nature, and by so doing, understand the origins of chaos we are experiencing today.
            </ins></p>
             <p><ins class="text">In Jaguar’s Vision, the jaguar represents nature, which was once revered as sacred by
humans (Jaguars are considered sacred in South America). By turning jaguars into objects
and commodities, humans exploit nature as a mirror onto which they project their desires.
In creating the animation, I referenced the realistic yet frozen look of dioramas in natural
history museums. Sound for the film was edited by sound designer and musician, Christian
Amigo.

Marshall Islands. Black Snow is a tale based on the archival footage of these tests and the
on-going threats imposed on the lives and of the native people and the natural environment

of the islands. The native islanders who were living further from the Bikini Atoll (the site of
the first atomic test - Operation Crossroads) were not aware of the devastating effects of the
radiation at the time of the test as they were not informed properly. It is told that some
natives mistook the nuclear fallouts as snow and ate them. After the tests, the US officials
advised the natives not to consume the local food, such as coconuts, which were part of their
staple diet. Instead, the US government provided processed and canned food, which
increased the rate of diabetes, obesity and other health issues of the native population.

gotten cracks and it is releasing toxic materials to the ocean and the land. The concrete
dome was supposed to last for 20,000 years. After 60 years, the radiation generated by the
series of atomic bomb tests threaten the Marshallese and the ecosystem of the Pacific ocean.

American freedom, masculinity, and economic success in a kingdom of capitalist automatons.
In the game, the cologne bottles are lined up like soldiers guarding Trump castle, a distant

dimensional, thin and feeble; you can knock them over like a house of cards reminiscent of
Alice’s encounter with the playing cards guarding the palace of the Queen of Hearts. The
emasculated soldiers/cologne bottles/playing cards serve to protect the power of the
monarch despite their flimsy reality. The user is immersed in this sea of cologne bottles, left
to wallow in the absurdities of American capitalist ideologies, and ponder whether one can
truly purchase “success.”

body on rotating sushi plates, she invites others to consume her body by presenting herself
as a delectable delicacy like the thinly sliced pieces of fish. At the same time, she reminds
the consumers that what they consume is only a temporary, futile fantasy. In the latter half of
the song, the artist expands beyond the subject of sexual discrimination to address the issues
of race, as well as other stereotypes and misjudgment of others, singing about how these
factors limit the relationship and experience between humans.

            <p>  <ins class="text">A poem and drawings by Chang are soldered onto the leather of a cow. The poem reflects on
life and death in a moment when one seeks refuge from the pain of love and loss, longing to
reunite with the lover who helped spark her inner self, against the backdrop of wind, ocean,
and cliff. Under the dystopian circumstances today, the work feels more realistic than ever.
The drawings in the work explore the artist’s natural instincts such as sense, taste, emotion,
and sexual orientation that are untamed and uncontrolled by conventions. Each element is
drawn with a smoldering iron, reeking the burning smell of skin of an animal that was once
alive. At first, the leather attempts to protect the flesh that is no longer underneath, but
ultimately gives in to the heat as it shrivels. The skin is then filled with fragile and delicate
stories that cannot be easily shared with others, only revealed onto the surface through a
closer look.

pandemic. The artist draws her everyday life on a small piece of paper like an illustrated
diary, and shares the changes in her life and emotional state with others through this
analogue medium. Those who receive the postcards can respond in their own manner,
whether in one-on-one communication with the artist or in open conversation with the
general public. This organic form of communication not only overcomes the physical
limitations of a conventional art space, but also allows the viewers to experience the slow
and intimate connection between people in an age saturated by digital media. The majority of
participants in the project live overseas, and the work hopes to provide an opportunity to
deeply reflect on the meaning of life through the act of empathy and care.

            <p>  <ins class="text">Because she is not skillful with audio, many of Chang’s previous projects simply ended up as
noise. The artist understood how such noise may not appeal to the audience, and therefore,
for this work, she only collected sounds that may evoke positive memories. The sounds in
this work would have been considered familiar, everyday noise even a year ago, but feel
rather distant now in the age of the pandemic. The sounds were edited from video footages
filmed by the artist in the past. From the bells chiming from a cathedral in a small Italian
village, music from a jazz club, the sound of making a wooden sculpture, a hungry stray cat
licking on food, to the tuning sound of an orchestra – the once mundane but beautiful sounds
of everyday life remind us of the precious and valuable moments from the past.

the threshold between life and death. The reason why well-fermented and aged things smell
fragrant is because they have accepted the constant feeling of death, and therefore, has no
fear. Everything becomes joy when one accepts all death. Joy flows and dance follows. This
is the scent of fermentation. Authentic communication with the world begins through the
scent of fermentation through the body.

            <p> <ins class="text">Through my relationship with the black ink fish (octopus), I imagine the emergence of a new
language, for a new kind of existence that disrupts the narrow-minded ideologies of our

anthropocentric world. Humans have continued to ignore the language of the Earth and have
forgotten what they needed to be. The language that centered around humans now seems
like the stale nostalgia of last century. The language of this new existence is a tainted and
hybrid language, which is only made possible through failure, and by escaping the perfect
language.
</ins></p> 
            <p> <ins class="text">Practicing this hybrid language, the performers shift away from the space of humans to sing a
song for the octopus in the water. This song is an altered form of communication that is
difficult to comprehend, and physically unsustainable in a new space. It is without a beginning
or end, and escapes the structures of the past, present, and future. It is a language without
boundaries between the self and others, subject and object.
</ins></p>
           <p> <ins class="text">This project had to be modified from its original filming plan due to the unexpected
conditions of COVID-19. I decided to proactively acknowledge this situation. I stayed in my
place while the performers also performed from their respective places. I communicated the
basic instructions to my performers in two places, Korea and Indonesia, and asked them to
perform as they interpreted them. I accepted any element of chance that emerged from these
two places, and after reviewing the video clips, allowed my own intentions to naturally
diverge from the original plan. The process of this work involved many layers of change, but
was ultimately a journey towards the freedom of language through failure and the chaos of
change.

a piece about wireless energy, copper coils, magnetic induction, remote controls and Nikola
Tesla.
</ins></p> 
           <p> <ins class="text">
The figure of Nikola Tesla has fascinated me since a long time. He was the person who
imagined wireless communication in an era when there was hardly electricity. He was the
one who invented radio controlled devices and other new technologies beyond the generally
known limits of technology. Tesla had been picking up radio signals in New York since 1895
receiving them as far as thirty miles away. He was not only an inventor whose work was the
basis for the development of many electrical inventions and communication techniques of
today but was as well a very special person, a visionary who was unable to realize many of
his ideas because of money problems and as well his “difficult” character.
</ins></p>   
            <p> <ins class="text">
I discovered his work during my studies of electronics in Milan at the end of the seventies. In
that period I started to use the system of electromagnetic induction for my sound
installations. Tesla had invented and patented the first telephone amplifier in 1882 in
Budapest and, without knowing about its origin, I used a simple telephone amplifier with
incorporated small coils to listen to the sounds in my installations. Later on my work with
electromagnetic induction had developed into the series “Electrical Walks”, city walks with
special headphones which make audible the usually hidden electromagnetic fields around us.
In 2012 I visited the small museum of science in the city of Kosice in Slovakia. The museum

had many Tesla devices in their showroom and I got a special permission to test them. I
listened with my special induction headphones to the Tesla machines and was fascinated: a
thunderstorm of electromagnetic sounds.This was the moment when I decided to make a
piece about electrical remoteness.
</ins></p>
           <p> <ins class="text">
Tesla grew up in a small village in Austria (now Croatia) where electricity, radio, cars,
telephones, movies etc. were unknown in the time of his childhood. As a boy he loved nature
more than everything else. But already at the age of 36, in 1893, his inventions made it
possible that the world expo in the city of Chicago was illuminated by one hundred thousand
electrical lamps.
</ins></p>
             <p> <ins class="text">
The new technologies concerning light, radio, radar etc. were developing with an incredible
speed since then just as today the components of the digital world.
</ins></p>
             <p> <ins class="text">
I always asked myself what Tesla would have thought about internet, google, twitter,
facebook, apps etc. Was this the vision he had in mind when he invented his system of
wireless transmission of electrical signals? His working places were full of big heavy coils,
oscillators, metal towers etc. by which he tried to transfer energy without wires. Today we
almost forget that digital communication and storage is not based only on invisible remote
waves in the ether but that it needs server rooms which are much bigger and heavier than
Teslas equipment.
</ins></p>
             <p> <ins class="text">
“Teslas Dream” opens with the sounds of an original glass harmonica and sounds of magnetic
fields recorded in an old Austrian train station, followed by the electrical melodies of old
Tatra tramways in Bratislava (now almost disappeared). The sounds of discharges and
activities of Teslas devices gradually come in. During the piece the electromagnetic signals
change from the sounds of analog machines to the more actual fields of light systems,
security systems, power lines, banks, subways, airports, power stations etc. Various
electrical signals of digital communication slowly merge in and change again the sound
structure. The composition ends with the sounds of a luminous advertising, recorded in a
shopping centre in Las Vegas, accompanied by the faint vibrations of other signals from the
ether.
</ins></p>
             <p> <ins class="text">
Tesla wanted to reach the most remote places of the earth with electrical energy. Nothing
today is remote anymore.
</ins></p>
              <p> <ins class="text">
The glass armonica (an original instrument from the 19th century) was recorded at the
Musikinstrumentenmuseum in Berlin. All other recordings were made with electromagnetic
headphones and other custom made devices developed by Christina Kubisch. The original
electrical field recordings were made in Austria, Germany, Slovakia, Britain, Czech republic,
New York and Las Vegas.

Christina Kubisch represents the first generation of German sound artists. After studying
painting, music, and electronic engineering, she has worked in a variety of activities in
Europe and around the world, mainly in Berlin. She mainly presents performances and media
works of the 1970s, and has been working on sound installation and sculpture using
ultraviolet rays. In the late 1970s, Kubisch began working on electromagnetic induction, and
produced her first sound installation in 1980. In 2004, she introduced Electrical Walks in
Cologne, a work that focused on electromagnetic waves generated throughout the city as
public art. She devised special headphones that converted the electromagnetic waves in the
city, which existed as particles in the air, into audio signals. Audiences wearing headphones
walked around the city and heard new sounds generated by interactions between electronic

devices. This work was also carried out in Berlin, Karlsruhe, Bremen, Oxford and New York.
Since 2003, the artist has collaborated with various musicians and dancers and participated in
exhibitions and festivals, including Blurred Edges Festival (Hamburg, 2015), White Walls
Have Ears (Hong Kong, 2012), Invisible Geographies: Sound Art from Germany (New York,
2006). In 2008 she won the Honour Award of the German Sound Art Award Prix Ars
Electronica.

            <p> <ins class="text">Shiva honoured as one of the most innovative composers of her generation. Vapour is part of
her on-going engagement with cutting-edge electronic music culture – including the cut and
paste sampling of drum’n’bass and jungle and other de-constructions coming out of London
and Berlin’s music culture. Shiva&#39;s music is the outcome of a unique system of thought, which
treats acoustic space and time as her sculptor’s material to be shaped, creating an intense
tactile feel to works coaxed from her turntable technique. The sampling and replaying of her
previous work using dub plates adds another meta-layer of meaning, the compositions in a
perpetual state of re-manipulation. “The piece is called Vapour because the whole thing is
processed through my analogue space echo and sounds like thick, electronically produced
vapour” says Shiva.

Shiva Feshareki obtained a Doctorate of Music from the Royal College of Music, London and
is an acclaimed Iranian-British artist. Presenting work through collaboration with electronic
sound and classical orchestra, Feshareki explores the diverse context of experimental music
which crosses a classical form and an experimental methodology border. The artist was a
professor of the Royal College of Music during 2016-2017, and she has also served as a
director of the Brighter Sounds: Both Sides Now in 2018. Recently, she participated in
Electronic Music (Design Museum, London, 2021), Pioneras Electrónicas (Mexico City, 2020),
New Music Biennial (Southbank Centre, London, 2019) funded by the PRS foundation, and in
Ulverston Music Festival (London, 2010), National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain residency
program.

            <p> <ins class="text"><i>“If ‘evolution’ in the past referred to the process in which our ‘internal organs (heart, lung,
and etc.)’ gradually adapt based on solar energy, the term now signifies the process of
adapting to the rapid changes of the ‘external organs (cars, airplanes, etc.)’ that rely on the
Earth’s low-entropy. The unequal possession of external organs, along with the unequal
possession of the low-entropy reserve that produce those external organs, are the origins of
social conflict in an industrial society. This is in stark contrast to the relatively equal
possession of internal capital.” – Herman Daly</i></ins></p>
<p> <ins class="text">Unlike solar energy, which seems unlimited, fossil fuel and the greedy competition to control
its limited supply have caused major socioeconomic conflicts in modern industrial society and
finance. However, if this socioeconomic realm continues to expand and ultimately converge
with the boundaries of the ecosystem on the outside, society can no longer exist in this
exhausted world. This present moment calls for a shift in values, from external growth to
internal growth that allows for coexistence.</ins></p>
